 A landing page for newly released movies.

An important aspect to me is creating web projects that are well designed and can be used in the real-world.
To improve my skills and practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I followed this Udemy course, https://www.udemy.com/course/html-css-and-javascript-for-intermediate/, and developed a simple web app.

What I learned from this course:
* Creating a navbar and sidebar on one page
* CSS transitions & transforms
* Using a JavaScript Event Listener
* Creating a Dark-Mode Toggle
